## About KnowB4ueat

KnowB4ueat is dedicated to improving food safety for individuals with food allergies in Australia. Our platform empowers users to make informed choices about food products by providing allergen information through barcode scanning.

## The Problem

Australia has the highest incidence of food allergy in the world, and it's growing at a rapid rate. The country has seen a 7% year-on-year increase in food allergy fatalities over the last 15 years. It is estimated that there are more than 500,000 Australians with a diagnosed food allergy, and many more remain undiagnosed. Shopping for food products can be challenging and risky for individuals with food allergies, as they often struggle to find reliable allergen information.

## The Solution

The main concept behind KnowB4ueat is to provide a solution for individuals with food allergies. Our system is designed to detect allergens in food products through barcode scanning. Here's how it works:

- **Barcode Scanning**: Users can scan the barcode on food products using our application.

- **Allergen Information**: The system retrieves allergen information from our database and displays it to the user.

- **Informed Decisions**: Users can make informed decisions about whether a product is suitable for their dietary needs based on the allergen information provided.

- **Enhanced Safety**: By providing accurate allergen information, the project contributes to the safety of individuals with food allergies.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application offers a user-friendly interface for seamless barcode scanning and allergen information retrieval.

By providing this solution, KnowB4ueat aims to make shopping for food products safer and more convenient for individuals with food allergies, contributing to a healthier and more informed community.

## Technologies Used

KnowB4ueat is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js

  - MongoDB for the database
  - RESTful API architecture

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication
  - Passport.js for authentication strategies

- **Barcode Scanning**: Integration with barcode scanning libraries or APIs.

- **Database**: Storage of allergen information and product data.

- **Deployment**: Deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure)

- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
