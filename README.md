In our project, the data is stored in the back end.MySQL and PHPmyADMin together collectively established the back end of the project.


When a user specifies a food requirement or information about an allergy, the system retrieves data from the backend database, compares it to the current data, and notifies the user of the food's acceptability. Sting information and informs the user if the meal is edible or not.
